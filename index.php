					Before coming to Deep Dive, I was an Office and HR Manager at Mario's Pizza here in Albuquerque. Before <em>that</em>, I taught English to engineering students
				at the National University in Bogota, Colombia. I've also formally studied Fine Arts and Language Education, and have a strong base and continuing interest in psychology.

			<p>In my free time, I read both non-fiction and fiction extensively. I also love to make things and frequently can be found doing arts and craft projects,
			most recently focused in printmaking, pop-up cards, and woodworking. I live in Albuquerque, NM with my partner, Robert, and more than one billion tiny pets
			in our indoor garden, coral reef tank, and three freshwater fish tanks.
