		<h2>all about me!</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This site is about me, Noel. I am currently learning Web Development at the CNM Stemulus Center's Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. Before coming to Deep Dive, I was an Office and HR Manager at Mario's Pizza here in Albuquerque. <em>Before that</em>, I taught English to engineering students at the National University in Bogota, Colombia, and for one year I lived in a semi-truck with my partner, Robert while he worked as an over-the-road truck driver. I've also formally studied Fine Arts and Language Education, and have a strong base and continuing interest in psychology.

			<p>In my free time, I read both non-fiction and fiction extensively. I also love to make things and frequently can be found doing arts and craft projects, most recently focused in printmaking, pop-up cards, and woodworking. I live in Albuquerque, NM with my partner, Robert, and more than one billion tiny pets in our indoor garden, coral reef tank, and three freshwater fish tanks.
