			<div class="col-md-7"><p>This site is about me, Noel. I am currently learning Web Development at the CNM Stemulus Center's Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp.
					Before coming to Deep Dive, I was an Office and HR Manager at Mario's Pizza here in Albuquerque. Before <em>that</em>, I taught English to engineering students
				at the National University in Bogota, Colombia, and for one year I lived in a semi-truck with my partner,
					Robert while he worked as an over-the-road truck driver. I've also formally studied Fine Arts and Language Education, and have a strong base and continuing interest in psychology.

			<p>In my free time, I read both non-fiction and fiction extensively. I also love to make things and frequently can be found doing arts and craft projects,
			most recently focused in printmaking, pop-up cards, and woodworking. I live in Albuquerque, NM with my partner, Robert, and more than one billion tiny pets
			in our indoor garden, coral reef tank, and three freshwater fish tanks.

		<p> On the weekends, I enjoy racing at Sandia Speedway in my pro-charged 350 bored.10 small block 1956 white on sea-foam green Chevy. The sound of the High revving
			 motor, peaking at its rpm is a sound that most can only hear in a dream. And the best feeling in the world is leaving them little boys in the harsh New Mexico dust.
